Rory Kennedy's Take Every Wave captures the remarkable and unconventional life of legendary big wave surfer Laird Hamilton. Laird's incredible story began in 1960s Hawaii. Finding solace from an abusive home, he rebelled and funneled his energy into big wave Pipeline surfing, awakening a natural talent. More than an athlete with Hollywood good looks, Hamilton proved himself a true innovator, pushing conventions to the extreme and reinventing surfing throughout his career.
